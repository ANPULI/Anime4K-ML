# Anime4K-ML

This is the course project of _2019 Fall CSCI-SHU 360 Machine Learning_. This project proposes an improved Anime real-time up-scaling method using a Generative Adversarial Network for super resolution, based on [Anime4K](https://github.com/bloc97/Anime4K "Anime4K"): an open-source, high-quality real-time anime upscaling algorithm. The implementation of this project cannot be done without the insights derived from [Fast-SRGAN](https://github.com/HasnainRaz/Fast-SRGAN "Fast-SRGAN") and [Video2X](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x "Video2X").
